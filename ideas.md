- How well do zero-order optimization methods do for ML applications, compared to standard first-order
- Meta-Learning: Can you learn the learning rate? The importance of each datapoint? The direction or
curvature?
1) Effect of gradient clipping on optimization:
   - Does gradient clipping help finding good local minima? 
   - How sensitive are different optimizers to gradient clipping?
   - Is there a relation between the model size and the performance of gradient clipping?
2) Impact of Activation Functions
